•  Annotating alternatives

a) You should use the concept <code>and-or</code> followed by 2 :ops whenever the sentence contains the alternative “and/or”.

e.g.: 

<i>the war on Iraq and/or Afghanistan</i></br>
<i>Americans, especially Republican Americans, have largely left issues of racism and/or stereotypical prejudice and bigotry well behind them.</i>

b) You should use <code>slash</code> concept, followed by 2 :ops whenever the text contains 2 alternatives of the type “x/y”:

e.g.:

<i>If we don't turn away from Iraq and Afghanistan to rebuild/recover our strength.</i></br>
<i>while she/he gave testimony</i>
